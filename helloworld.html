	<p><em>
		I met and fell in love with my pet fish Mr blue when i saw him swimming in the aquarium in the pet store and immediately my baby nephew named him blue.</br>
	    Mr Blue usually spends most of time swimming lazily in his bowl during the day and seems to be more active at night time.</br>
	    Mr blue eats fish flakes, we feed him in the morning and evening. Usually when he is full, he just swims away from the top of his bowl.
